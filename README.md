# GameHub

GameHub is a web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It features a collection of games that users can browse, search, and sort by various categories. I currently deployed it with vercel and you can find it here; https://game-hub-beige-three.vercel.app/

## Features

- **Browse Games:** View a list of all available games.
- **Search:** Find games by name or keywords.
- **Sort:** Organize games by different criteria such as category, popularity, and release date.
- **Filter:** Narrow down the list of games by specific categories.
